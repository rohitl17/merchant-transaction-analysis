# merchant-transaction-analysis
A project on analyzing over a million transactions for merchant churn prediction and clustering

Financial transactions could be analyzed from multiple perspectives including but not limited to â€“ transaction amounts, frequency, and the number of transactions. The goal of our analysis is to make use of such transactions aggregated at a merchant level and suggest offers and benefits using gamification to the customers to keep them engaged with Stripe. Another goal is to predict the risk of merchants discontinuing software use in the future. This could help in targeting those merchants with specific schemes and questions for quantitative and qualitative feedback to help and improve the service.
